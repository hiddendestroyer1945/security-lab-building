*   **IT Security**:    IT security is the sum of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Adequate security is a balance between the value of the assets in the network and the cost of protection. The level of security is measured by calculating the value of defense in depth. Defense in depth means configuring security in layers.
*   As an organization changes over time, the level of IT security required by the organization will also change as the organization's networks, the hardware and software running on the network, the type of operations the organization does, and the organization's needs, goals, and interests change.
