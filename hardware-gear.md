* **Assembling the Network**:  When building an IT security lab network, it is not possible to build a security lab network that meets future needs. Because the security lab has different needs in each era. After building a basic security lab network, devices according to the needs of each era of the security lab are added to the security lab network in that era. But, if an IT security lab network is being built for large organizations, a complex security lab network is built that meets all the possible needs of the security lab networks in that era.
* **Steps of IT Security Lab Network Building**:  Building an IT security lab network involves the steps of setting up the devices, configuring the network, installing operating systems on physical computers, connecting all the devices on the network, and adding devices to the network.
  * **Starting Clean**:  When building an IT security lab network, if the security lab network is built using previously used devices, then the errors and mistakes in the configurations of these devices will continue in this security lab network and In order to properly manage this security lab network, it is necessary to configure it from scratch, for this all configurations of all the devices selected for this purpose should be removed before building the security lab network. But if the security lab network is built using new devices, this step can be skipped. For this, a reset button is used on network devices, but data on computers is removed using data wiping software.
  * **Configuring the Network**:  In order to create an IT security lab network that is separate from the production networks but can communicate with each other as needed, the necessary configurations are configured on the border router in this network, then the necessary configurations are configured on the firewall in this network, then the necessary configurations are configured on the switch in this network, then the necessary configurations are configured on the NAS in this network, then the backups of these configurations are collected on the external hard drive that stores backups of the IT security lab network, and notes of these configurations are made and kept.
    * **Border Router Configuration**:  To create an IT security lab network, any computer and broadband line are connected to the border router in this network and then the router and computer are powered on. Then, obtain the gateway IP address of the computer from the computer and access this router through a browser using this gateway IP address. Then, access the configuration page of this router using the default username and password of this router available from the manual of this router. Then, configure the DHCP configurations using IP addresses other than the static IP addresses of this security lab network on this configuration page. Then, on this configuration page, configure the network configurations for each network port of this router and configure the broadband configurations of this router. Then change the user account configurations of this router, and update the firmware of this router.

Then, in this installation setup, configure the networks in different IP address ranges of the LAN-1 port and LAN-2 port of this firewall computer and configure the DHCP IP address pools after avoiding the static IP addresses in these networks. Then any static IP address on the LAN-1 port of the border router in this security lab network is configured on the WAN port of this firewall computer. Then, the web configuration IP address of this firewall computer is available. Then, in the web browser of the computer connected to the LAN-1 port of this firewall computer, by using the web configuration IP address of this firewall computer and entering the admin user account and password of this firewall computer, access the web configuration page of this firewall computer and configure the necessary security configurations and monitoring configurations on the web configuration page of this firewall computer, as well as control configurations that can be enabled and disabled when needed.

Then, from the computer connected to the switch, ping each of the IP addresses on the network on the LAN-1 port of the firewall to find the IP address of the managed switch on the network. Then, using a web browser on a computer connected to the switch, access the managed switch using the IP address of the managed switch on the network and access the web configuration page of the managed switch using the default username and password available from the switch's manual. Then, on this web configuration page of the managed switch, configure the necessary IT Security Lab network configurations and mirror port configurations to monitor the data distributed on this network. Then, change the user account configurations of this switch, configure any static IP address on the LAN-1 port of the firewall on the network as the IP address of this switch, and update the switch's firmware if necessary.
    * **NAS Configuration**:  To create an IT security lab network, connect a NAS computer with multiple hard disks to the LAN-2 port of a managed switch in the network, connect any computer to any other LAN port of this managed switch, and power-on the border router, firewall, and managed switch in this network. Then connect the bootable pendrive of the open source NAS operating system to this NAS computer and install it. Then set up the root user account and admin user account of this NAS computer in this installation setup itself. Then configure the any static IP address in the network of the LAN-1 port of the firewall in the network as the IP address of this NAS computer. Then configure the hostname of this NAS computer as well.  Then, using a web browser on a computer connected to the switch, access the managed switch using the IP address of the managed switch on the network and access the web configuration page of the managed switch using the default username and password available from the switch's manual.
