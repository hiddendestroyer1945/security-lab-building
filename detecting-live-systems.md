# Detecting Live Systems
* **Description**: This document explains the processes used to detect active devices on an organization's network, the programs used in these processes, the associated protocols, and the defensive measures taken to prevent system detection.

* **Introduction**: After gathering information about an organization's domain and its network, this document describes the programs and technologies used to discover network devices, computers, and virtual machines actively running on that network. Additionally, this document also explains the protocols used in these programs and how they work.

* **Port Scanning**: Port scanning is used to discover physical and virtual devices and their associated services on an organization's network. Specifically, it identifies the operating system version and server software configured on active devices. This process helps security experts detect systems running vulnerable software versions that could be exploited.
 
* **IT Security Lab Network Reset**: Verify the functionality of port scanning tools within the IT Security Lab software test platform. If these tools are not operating correctly, configure the necessary ports on network devices (including firewalls) and reconfigure the test platform to ensure proper functionality.

* **Detecting Active Systems**: Port scanning, wardriving, and wardialing are used to discover active devices on an organization's network. While wardriving and wardialing serve as alternatives for device discovery, ICMP is typically used to detect active devices on wireless networks identified through wardriving.
* Port scanning is used to discover active systems via ICMP operations and subsequently identify the services and applications running on those devices.
  * **Wardriving**: Wardialing detects unsecured dial-up modems on a telephone network, whereas wardriving identifies unsecured wireless access points within a specified area. Wardriving can provide unauthorized access to an organization's primary network through unsecured wireless connections.
  * Network firewalls, VPNs, and IDSs are commonly used to protect internal networks. However, an improperly configured wireless access point placed behind a firewall can bypass these protections. Securing wireless networks requires implementing modern encryption protocols and addressing vulnerabilities in legacy algorithms.
    * **Wardriving Protections**: Network firewalls, VPNs, and IDSs are used to protect organization's networks from wireless networks and wardriving processes via wireless networks.
      * **Network Firewalls**: Firewalls are used to protect an organization's users and assets from specific types of network traffic. If you configure a network firewall at the border router of the organization's network or the IT security lab network, you can monitor and filter traffic to protect internal resources, allowing or blocking specific protocols as needed.
      * **VPNs**: A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is used to route communication over the Internet through a secure channel or tunnel and to encrypt this communication.
      * **IPS**: An intrusion prevention system (IPS) monitors incoming, outgoing, and internal network traffic. It detects and blocks malicious traffic patterns while allowing legitimate communication based on defined security rules.
      * **Encryption**: Encryption can prevent the leakage of data being collected or transmitted.
    * **Wardriving Programs**: This describes programs used to detect and access unsecured wireless networks, either through the organization's wireless network or through the wireless networks of key individuals in the organization, in order to gain access to the organization's network.
      * **Kismet**: This program is used for wardriving to discover wireless networks. To use it, you need a wireless NIC adapter that can monitor wireless network traffic and inject data packets into the wireless network, and a laptop that can connect to it.
      * **Netdiscover**: This program is used for wardriving to discover wireless devices and find the IP range of these wireless devices. To use it, you need a wireless NIC adapter that can monitor wireless network traffic and inject data packets into the wireless network, and a laptop that can connect to it.
      * **Gpsd**: This program is used to perform wardriving to detect GPS devices and discover wireless networks on those GPS devices. That is, it uses `gpsd` to detect GPS devices and uses Kismet to discover wireless networks on those GPS devices. To use it, you need a GlobalSat BU-353-S4 dongle and a laptop that can connect to it.
  * **ICMP**: ICMP, which stands for Internet Control Message Protocol, is a part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. It is used to diagnose problems in networks. ICMP is a network diagnostic protocol that generates and sends error messages to the network to indicate any problems in the network. This explains how it works and what it is designed for.
  * After identifying connected wireless networks, ICMP is used to map out the organization's internal network and identify active physical and virtual devices.
    * **ICMP Restrictions**: Any network device using the TCP/IP suite can process ICMP messages. To prevent "ping flooding" or reconnaissance, administrators should restrict ICMP operations. Common strategies include treating ICMP as normal traffic without priority, rejecting unsolicited ICMP packets, limiting replies to multicast/broadcast requests, or using alternative diagnostic protocols when ICMP is disabled.
    * **Ping & Sweep Programs**: Since the protocol does not specify what data should be in an ICMP packet, ICMP can be used for different purposes and different uses. Different programs are used for this. Additionally, sweep programs are used to ping all IP addresses in the IP address range of the organization's network, one after the other, using ICMP to identify which devices on the organization's network are activated. These two categories of programs are also explained here. 
      * **Ping**: Ping is an ICMP program used to test network connectivity. But, ping is also used to check whether a device at a specific IP address on an organization's network is operational.
      * An ICMP Echo Request is sent to a specified IP address on the organization's network and the device at that specified IP address is identified as operational based on the reply message received.
      * **Fping**: This program is used to ping all the IP addresses on an organization's network one after the other, to identify which devices are running on that network.
      * **Hping3**: This program is used to ping all IP addresses connected to the router found at a specific IP address on the organization's network using ICMP. This allows you to identify which devices are active among the devices connected to that router.
      * **Nmap**: This is a port scanning program. This program is used to ping all IP addresses on an organization's network using ICMP, one after the other. This allows you to determine which devices on the organization's network are activated.
  * **Port Scanning**: Ping and sweep programs are used to discover active physical and virtual devices on an organization's network that does not have ICMP filtering configured. Since firewalls and gateways in such a network typically block ICMP traffic, port scanning programs are required for effective discovery.
  * Port scanning involves connecting a testing computer to the TCP and UDP ports of services and applications to identify what is running on an organization's physical and virtual devices. This activity helps determine the appropriate type of penetration testing to perform on each device.
  * To prevent detection of active physical and virtual devices on an organization's network using port scanning, the protocols for each specific service are configured to run on some other dynamic port instead of the designated TCP and UDP ports assigned to them. The reason for doing this is that by scanning the designated port for each specific protocol, it is possible to verify whether a specific protocol or service is running on devices on the network. Additionally, data transfer through all ports other than those in use on the organization's network or devices must be blocked. This is because while data transfer through some protocols is secure, data transfer through many other protocols is not. If the ports of such insecure protocols are open on the network, there is a high chance that an attacker can use them to attack the network.
    * **TCP/IP Basics**: To understand the information available through port scanning of physical and virtual devices on an organization's network and to decide what type of port scanning to perform, you must know the basics of the TCP/IP protocol stack.
    * All devices on a network communicating over TCP/IP support the protocols within the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) suites. Each unique protocol in the TCP/IP stack was developed for a particular purpose. The IANA [Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml) describes each protocol and the port numbers it uses. A security expert should understand the operation of the most critical and commonly used protocols in the TCP/IP stack.
    * As the Internet grew, the TCP/IP protocol stack evolved to meet its needs. The designers of the early protocols (which operated in a more trusted environment) prioritized flexibility over security, leading to inherent vulnerabilities. While IPv4 remains widely used, networks are migrating to IPv6, which includes native support for security features like IPsec to protect data transmission.
      * **Wireshark**: To examine the workings of protocols in the TCP/IP stack, you can use packet analyzer programs like Wireshark to analyze the encapsulation and structure of network traffic. Therefore, we explain how to configure Wireshark on Debian-based Linux operating systems and how to analyze captured data.
      * During installation on a Debian-based system, select **Yes** when prompted to allow non-superusers to capture packets. This allows your regular user account to perform network analysis without requiring root privileges. Run the following commands to install Wireshark, add your account to the `wireshark` group, and apply the group changes:
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y wireshark
        sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
        newgrp wireshark
        ```
      * Once configured, use the following command to identify your active network interface (e.g., `eth0` or `wlan0`):
        ```bash
        ip addr show
        ```
      * Launch Wireshark, select the identified network interface, and begin capturing data packets.
      * While Wireshark is running, it captures network traffic generated by other programs as they communicate across the network. These captured packets are then available for detailed inspection and analysis of the underlying protocols.
      * Wireshark displays captured data in two primary sections:
        * **Packet List Pane**: Shows a summary of each packet, including the capture time, source and destination IP addresses, protocol, length, and basic info.
        * **Packet Details Pane**: Provides a detailed, hierarchical view of the frames and protocols within a selected packet for in-depth analysis.
      * **TCP/IP Stack**: The TCP/IP stack is a suite of communication protocols organized into a layered architecture. This structure allows different protocols to work together to enable seamless communication between devices. This is achieved through the complementary processes of encapsulation and decapsulation:
        * **Encapsulation**: The process of adding headers (and sometimes trailers) to data as it moves down the layers from Application to Network Access. Each layer wraps the data from the layer above with its own control information.
        * **Decapsulation**: The process of removing headers and trailers as data moves up through the layers at the destination device, eventually delivering the original data to the receiving application.
      * The TCP/IP stack consists of four primary layers:
        * **Network Access Layer**: The foundation of the stack, responsible for the physical and logical transmission of data across the network medium. Protocols like Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and PPP operate here.
        * This layer encapsulates IP packets from the Internet layer into **data frames** by adding a MAC header containing source and destination hardware addresses. Encapsulated data frames are converted into binary signals and made available to the network.
        * At the destination, the layer converts binary signals back into data frames, verifies the MAC addresses, and removes the MAC header (decapsulation) before passing the packets up.
          * **MAC Address**: A 48-bit unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication within a network segment. It is typically represented in hexadecimal format (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).
          * The first 24 bits are the **Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)**, assigned by the IEEE to the manufacturer.
          * The remaining 24 bits are the **Extension Identifier**, uniquely assigned by the manufacturer to that specific NIC.
          * **MAC Address Discovery**:
          * In Linux, use `ip link show` to find the local MAC address; in Windows, use `ipconfig /all`.
          * The `arp -a` command displays the local ARP cache, which contains the IP-to-MAC mappings for all recently contacted devices on the network segment (including the router).
          * Additionally, you can use [maclookup.app](https://maclookup.app/) to identify the NIC manufacturer using the OUI portion of a MAC address.
        * **Internet Layer**: Responsible for logical addressing and routing packets across networks. Key protocols include **IP** (addressing), **ICMP** (diagnostics) and **ARP** (address resolution).
        * In Encapsulation, When data descends from the Host-to-Host layer, the Internet Layer receives a **segment** (TCP) or **datagram** (UDP). It adds an **IP Header**, transforming the data into an **IP Packet**.  and passes the remaining data packet to network access layer.
        * In De-Capsulation, When a packet arrives at the destination or a router, the Internet Layer processes the **IP Packet**. It verifies the destination IP address. It removes the IP header (**decapsulation**) and passes the remaining payload (the segment or datagram) up to the Host-to-Host Layer.
          * **IP (Internet Protocol)**: A connectionless protocol that provides logical addressing and routing of packets across networks.
            * **IP Address**: A 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6) address assigned to a device for communication within a network. It is typically represented in decimal format (e.g., `192.168.1.1` or `2001:db8::1`). 
            * **IPV4 Classes**: IPV4 addresses are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. Each class has a different range of addresses and is used for different purposes.
              * **Class A**: Addresses from 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 (1-126). These addresses are used for large networks with a large number of devices. It's subnet mask is `255.0.0.0`. This class private IP address range is `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`.
              * **Class B**: Addresses from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 (128-191). These addresses are used for medium-sized networks with a medium number of devices. It's subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`. This class private IP address range is `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`.
              * **Class C**: Addresses from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 (192-223). These addresses are used for small networks with a small number of devices. It's subnet mask is `255.255.255.0`. This class private IP address range is `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`.
              * **Class D**: Addresses from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 (224-239). These addresses are used for multicast communication.
              * **Class E**: Addresses from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (240-255). These addresses are reserved for future use.
            * **IPV6 Classes**: IPV6 addresses are divided into three classes: unicast, multicast, and anycast. Unicast addresses are used for single device communication, multicast addresses are used for group communication, and anycast addresses are used for load balancing.
            * **IP Address Finding**: The command `ip addr show` is used to find the IP address in Linux operating systems, and the command `ipconfig /all` is used to find the IP address in Windows operating systems.
            * **Uses of Internet Protocol**: Internet Protocol (IP) is used to identify devices on a network, to specify a specific path through source routing, and for datagram fragmentation.
            * **Source Routing**: The data header of a data packet processed at the Internet layer contains only the source IP address and the destination IP address. The data header of the data packet does not specify which IP addresses to route through to reach the destination IP address; that is determined by network devices such as routers operating at the Internet layer. The router that receives the data packet directs the data packet to the next IP address on the path with the least traffic to reach the destination IP address in the data packet. This process continues on each router until the data packet reaches the destination IP address in the data header. Therefore, using this functionality, the client's request packets and the data packets that the server provides for this request can be retrieved from the server using the client's IP address.
            * **Datagram Fragmentation**: Datagram fragmentation is the process of breaking a datagram into smaller pieces if it is to be sent data in a larger datagram than is allowed by the network access layer of a specified topology in the TCP/IP stack. This process is performed by the Internet Protocol. That is, the Internet layer understands the length that the network access layer can accept for each data packet passing through the router. If the data packets are larger than that acceptable length, the Internet Protocol divides each data packet into smaller data packets within that acceptable length, adds the information about that fragmentation to the more bit in the IP header, then makes these data packets available to the network through the network access layer. But, this overlapping security flaw in datagram fragmentation can be exploited to conduct overlapping fragmentation attacks and teardrop attacks.          
          * **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: ICMP is a protocol used to send error messages and control messages between devices on a network. ICMP messages are constructed in a basic format. Therefore, it is possible to understand what type of ICMP message it is from the IP header of the ICMP. If any ICMP message is sent to any specific IP address and monitored using Wireshark, it can be understood by examining the IP header of that specific IP address available in that Wireshark.
          * **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: Operates as a critical bridge between the Internet and Network Access layers by mapping logical IP addresses to physical MAC addresses. That is, ARP is used to provide the MAC addresses of target IP addresses from the target to the source. A router on a network sends an ARP request message to all of its IP addresses, updates the router's ARP cache by storing the responding IP addresses as active IP addresses on the port where the reply is received, and flushes the non-responding IP addresses from the router's ARP cache. A switch on a network sends an ARP request message to all of its ports, updates the switch's ARP cache by storing the responding ports as active ports in the switch's ARP cache, and flushes the non-responding ports from the switch's ARP cache. The ARP cache is updated by repeating this process on networks regularly. Since routers and firewalls perform ARP operations based on IP addresses, but switches can only understand MAC addresses, the switch performs ARP operations based on MAC addresses, but since the hub does not have an ARP cache, the hub will continue to perform ARP operations continuously.
          * ARP attacks are used to bypass the functionality of the switch. Since devices send ARP replies without verifying the authenticity of the source of ARP requests, the router does not forward ARP packets to outside networks. ARP communication can only take switched between devices within a trusted network. ARP attacks can be carried out by redirecting network traffic from devices that are switched to a trusted network. ARP is used for man-in-the-middle attacks, spoofing attacks, and session hijacking attacks. ARP proxies are used for this. That is, it connects to a wireless network by using Wardriving, attacks computers on that network with ARP poisoning, and then uses Wireshark to monitor the data packets reaching those computers and collect the necessary information.
        * **Host-to-Host (Transport) Layer**: Manages end-to-end communication and data flow control. The protocols used in this layer are **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** and **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**. **TCP** provides reliable, connection-oriented delivery, while **UDP** offers faster, connectionless transmission. Data at this layer is called **segments** (TCP) or **datagrams** (UDP).
          * **Ports**: Ports are 16-bit logical numbers (ranging from 0 to 65535) assigned to specific processes or services. Ports are used to identify specific network services and protocols. Different types of ports are used for different purposes.
            * **Well-known ports (0-1023)**: These ports are reserved for well-known services and protocols. For example, port 80 is used for HTTP, port 443 is used for HTTPS, and port 21 is used for FTP.
            * **Registered ports (1024-49151)**: These ports are used for registered services and protocols. For example, port 1080 is used for SOCKS proxy, port 1433 is used for Microsoft SQL Server database management system, and port 1476 is used for WIFI pineapple Hack5.
            * **Dynamic/Private ports (49152-65535)**: These ports are used for dynamic services and protocols in own network. For example, port 8080 is used for HTTP server in my own web server, port 8443 is used for HTTPS(HTTP with SSL/TLS) server in my own web server, and port 2121 is used for FTP server in my own web server.
            * **TCP Port & UDP Port**:  The same number port is used for the specified protocol in TCP and other specified protocol in UDP. For example, UDP port 53 is used for DNS and TCP port 53 is used for DNS zone transfer.
          * **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: TCP is a connection-oriented protocols that provides reliable data transfer. It uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection, and it uses sequence numbers and acknowledgments to ensure that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors. And it also performs a four-way session shutdown to complete the data transfer. TCP is used for applications that require reliable data transfer, such as web browsing, email, and file transfer. This can be checked and understood using Wireshark.
          * TCP's specified packet structure is used to control the flow of packet transmission, reliably deliver data packets, and ensure that lost data packets are retransmitted. These functions are performed by an 8-bit flag in the TCP header of TCP protocols. Depending on the type of TCP packet, TCP uses different flags, such as synchronize, acknowledge, push, finish, reserved, urgent, and resight. This means that each of these types of flags performs a different type of TCP operation. TCP is used for TCP sequence number attacks, session hijacking attacks, and synchronized flood attacks. Port scanning programs such as Nmap use TCP flags to detect active devices on a network.
          * TCP protocols use the Acknowledgement flag and the Synchronize flag for a three-way handshake before data transfer. But, the fine flag is used to end the session and the reset flag is used to end the session abnormally. But, the push flag is used to provide data without buffering operations and the urgent flag is used to determine the priority of the data packet. However, attacks can be carried out by modifying the TCP packet and the TCP packet's checksum value, because networks use the checksum value to verify the authenticity of TCP packets.
          * In TCP encapsulation, the application layer passes data to the host-to-host layer. TCP then breaks the large data stream into smaller pieces called segments. To each of these segments, TCP attaches a header (usually 20 bytes). This header converts the raw data into a TCP segment. The source/destination ports are added to this TCP header to ensure that the data reaches the correct application. A unique number is assigned to each of these segments in the TCP header to ensure that the data is not lost. A checksum value is added to this TCP header to check if the data is corrupted. Each of these segments is then passed to the Internet layer.
          * In TCP de-encapsulation, the Internet layer strips the IP header and passes the "TCP segment" to the host-to-host layer. The host-to-host layer looks at the TCP header to check for errors using a checksum. If it is corrupted, it discards the segment and asks the sender to try again. Otherwise, it looks at the TCP sequence numbers. If the segments are out of order (e.g., segment #3 arrived before #2), TCP keeps them in a buffer until the missing pieces arrive and puts them in the correct order. Once the data is verified and ordered, TCP strips the TCP header. It then passes the clean, original data to the application layer.
          * **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides unreliable data transfer. It does not use a three-way handshake to establish a connection, and it does not use sequence numbers or acknowledgments to ensure that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors. The specialty of UDP protocols is the fast transfer of packets. UDP is used for applications that require fast data transfer, such as streaming video, online gaming, and voice over IP. DNS is the most important protocol that runs on UDP. Since UDP does not have any of the security features of TCP, UDP protocols can be easily attacked.
          * In UDP encapsulation, the application layer takes the UDP data block as it is when it sends the data to the host-to-host layer. It does not perform "segmentation" like TCP; if the data is too large, it relies on the Internet layer to handle it later. UDP attaches a very small, 8-byte UDP header. This converts the data into a UDP datagram. The source port and destination port are added to this UDP header to ensure that the data reaches the correct application. The UDP header specifies the length of the datagram. A checksum value is added to the UDP header to check for data corruption. Each of these datagrams is passed to the Internet layer.
          * In UDP de-encapsulation, the Internet layer strips the IP header and passes the UDP datagram to the host-to-host layer. The host-to-host layer looks at the UDP header to check for errors using a checksum. If the checksum value changes (meaning the data is corrupted), the UDP datagram is discarded. It is not requested to be retransmitted. If the checksum value does not change, the UDP 8-byte header is stripped. UDP looks at the destination port and passes the data to the corresponding application in the application layer.
        * **Application Layer**: Provides network services directly to user applications. It is also responsible for data representation, including encryption, decryption, compression, and decompression. In encapsulation at this layer, data received at this layer via TCP ports or UDP ports at the host-to-host layer is decompressed and decrypted. It then uses the information in the available data to establish a session with the server and present that data to the application layer.
      * **Unsecured Protocols**: Describes insecure protocols that can discover active devices on a network through port scanning.
        * **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**:  FTP is a protocol that is used to transfer files between a client and a server. This is a TCP protocol. It works using port 20 and 21. Port 20 is used for data transfer and port 21 is used for control commands transfer for this protocol. It is a connectionless protocol that uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection, and it uses sequence numbers or acknowledgments to ensure that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors. FTP is used for applications that require reliable data transfer, such as web browsing, email, and file transfer. This can be checked and understood using Wireshark.
        * Standard FTP does not use encryption. User credentials are transmitted over the network in "clear-text". Additionally, data transferred using FTP is transmitted over the network unencrypted. Additionally, FTP has an old feature that allows a user to request data to be sent to a third-party IP address. All of this makes FTP a prime source of intrusion, and FTP can be detected using port scanning, thereby discovering active devices on the network.
        * When configuring FTP on an organization's network, you can secure this protocol by configuring it on any other dynamic port instead of port 20 and 21. And You can also make FTP more secure by using SFTP or FTPS instead of standard FTP.
        * **Telnet**: Telnet is a protocol that is used to transfer files between a client and a server. This is a TCP protocol. It works using port 23. It is a connectionless protocol that uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection, and it uses sequence numbers or acknowledgments to ensure that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors. It is used for remote host access. Although anonymous network connections allow this, data and credentials are transmitted to the network in plain text. This can be checked and understood using Wireshark. Remote access can be secured by using SSH instead of Telnet and configuring SSH to some other dynamic port instead of 22.
        * **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**: SMTP is a protocol used to send messages between a client and a server. This is a TCP protocol that runs on port 25. It is a connectionless protocol that uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection, and it uses sequence numbers or acknowledgments to ensure that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors. This can be checked and understood using Wireshark.
        * Since SMTP messages can be opened on all computers, spoofing and spamming emails can be used to collect information about the computer and network that opens these emails. It is possible to collect information about the client computer that sent this email from the SMTP header, but since the SMTP header of spoofing or spamming emails is modified, it is not possible to collect information about the computer that sent it from the headers of such emails. This can be solved by using email services such as Proton Mail, Tuta (Tutanota), and StartMail, as well as Tor VPN.
        * **Domain Name System (DNS)**: DNS is a protocol for finding the IP addresses of domain names and routing them to the server at that IP address. It accomplishes by combining TCP and UDP on port 53. It uses UDP to retrieve DNS information and TCP to transfer zone information. DNS is what provides the IP addresses of websites and domains on the Internet, so the Internet would not work without DNS.
        * Each DNS server will have an A record, AAA record, CAA record, CNAME record, NS record, MX record, PTR record, and SOA record. But, in DNS servers on the Internet, each record will have a separate zone database file. But, in local DNS servers configured on the network, all records are configured in a single zone database file. In the zone database files on the DNS servers, the hostnames of the hosts in the domain and their IPv4 addresses are configured in the A record, the hostnames of the domain and their IPv6 addresses are configured in the AAA record. The CAA record is used to specify the certificate authorities that are authorized to issue SSL/TLS certificates for the domain. The CAA record in the zone database files on the DNS server configure the domain name of the authority that checks the certificate for the specified domain for certificate authentication. The CNAME record in the zone database files on the DNS servers also configure the subdomain to which the domain points if the specified domain needs to be redirected to an subdomain. The NS record in the zone database files on the DNS servers also configures the name servers in the DNS for this domain. The MX record in the zone database files of the DNS server configure the mail server for this domain. The PTR record in the zone database files on DNS servers configures where the hostnames and their IP addresses for this domain are stored, and the SOA record configures which is the primary DNS server for this domain.
        * DNS cache poisoning attacks can be used to corrupt records on a DNS server by sending fake entries to the server, and DNS denial of service attacks can be used to perform unauthorized zone transfers.
        * **Trival File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)**: TFTP is a protocol that is used to transfer files between a client and a server. It is UDP based and runs on port 69. TFTP can be defined as a variant of the FTP protocol that operates without FTP's session management and authentication. It is used to implement CLI configurations on network devices. Since it is used without user account credentials, TFTP can be attacked using programs such as the Nimida worm.
        * **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: HTTP is a protocol used to transfer website data between a client and a server. This is a TCP protocol that runs on port 80. It is a connectionless protocol that uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection, and it uses sequence numbers or acknowledgments to ensure that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors. This protocol works by responding to an HTTP request issued by the client. HTTP is used for applications that require reliable data transfer, such as web browsing. This can be checked and understood using Wireshark. This protocol can be attacked by sending malicious scripts to TCP port 80 of the web server. This can be prevented by using HTTPS.
        * **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)**: SNMP is a protocol that is used to manage network devices. It is a UDP based protocol that runs on port 161 and 162. It is used to monitor and control network devices, such as routers, switches, and printers. SNMP can be used to collect information about network devices, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic. It can also be used to control network devices, such as restarting or shutting down devices. Any one SNMP program may be running on organization's networks. So this feature of SNMP can be used to monitor an organization's networks.This can be prevented by using SNMPv3. This is because the monitoring data provided using SNMPv3 is provided encrypted.
