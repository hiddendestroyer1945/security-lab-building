# Detecting Live Systems
* **Description**: It explains the processes used to detect active devices on an organization's domain's network, the programs used in each of these processes, the protocols used in these programs, and the actions taken to prevent the detection of devices running on an organization's domain network.

* **Introduction**: After gathering information about an organization's domain and its network, this document describes the programs and technologies used to discover network devices, computers, and virtual machines actively running on that network. Additionly this document also explains the protocols used in these programs and how these protocols work in those programs.

* **Port Scanning**: Port scanning is used to discover physical and virtual devices and the services on those devices in an organization's domain network. That is, port scanning is used to find out what operating system is running on a device in the organization's domain network, what version of that operating system is running, what server software is configured on it, and what version of that server software is running. Port scanning programs are used for this purpose. That is, devices using vulnerable versions of operating systems and server software are detected on the organization's domain network through port scanning.

That is, port scanning is used to find out what operating system is running on a device in the organization's domain network, what version of that operating system is running, what server software is configured on it, and what version of that server software is running. Port scanning programs are used for this purpose. That is, devices using vulnerable versions of operating systems and server software are detected on the organization's domain network through port scanning. 
* Check how the port scanning programs on the software test platform in the IT Security Lab network are working and if they are not working properly, the necessary ports on the network devices, including network firewalls, in the IT Security Lab network and the software test platform should be configured as opened and the IT Security Lab network and the software test platform should be reconfigured to ensure that they work properly.

* **Detecting Active Systems**: Port scanning, wardriving, and wardialing are used to discover active network devices, computers, or virtual devices on an organization's domain network. But, wardriving and wardialing are used as an alternative to port scanning to discover active network devices, computers, or virtual devices on an organization's domain network.
  * **Wardriving**: Wardialing is the process of detecting an unsecured dial-up modem used for Internet connectivity from a telephone network in a specified location, while wardriving is the process of detecting an unsecured wireless access point from wireless networks in a specified location. But, it is possible to access the organization's wireless networks or the wireless networks of key individuals in the organization through warddriving, and to access the organization's networks from those wireless networks.
  * Network firewalls, VPNs, and IDSs are used to protect organization's networks from wireless networks and wardriving processes via wireless networks. But, by configuring a wireless access point after the network firewall in the organization's network, it is possible to bypass all such protections and access organization's networks using the wardriving method. But, the real problem is not that wireless networks cannot be secured, but that we do not know how to secure them. Not implementing security in wireless networks and using old wireless algorithms and protocols with vulnerabilities put wireless networks at risk.
    * **Wardriving Protections**: Network firewalls, VPNs, and IDSs are used to protect organization's networks from wireless networks and wardriving processes via wireless networks.
      * **Network Firewalls**: Firewalls are used to protect an organization's users and assets from any specific type of network traffic. But, if configure a network firewall after the border router of the organization's network or the border router of the IT security lab network, you can protect the network after the border router from any specific network traffic that is needed and allow that network traffic when needed.
      * **VPNs**: A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is used to route communication over the Internet through a secure channel or tunnel and to encrypt this communication.
      * **IPS**: An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is used to monitor traffic going into and out of a network, as well as internal network traffic, it is possible thereby detecting and blocking intrusion traffic with specific patterns, and allowing such traffic with specific patterns when necessary.
      * **Encryption**: Encryption can prevent the leakage of data being collected or transmitted.
    * **Wardriving Programs**: This describes programs used to detect and access unsecured wireless networks, either through the organization's wireless network or through the wireless networks of key individuals in the organization, in order to gain access to the organization's network.
      * **Kismet**: This program is used for wardriving to discover wireless networks. To use it, need a wireless NIC adapter that can monitor wireless network traffic and inject data packets into the wireless network, and a laptop that can connect to it.
      * **Netdiscover**: This program is used for wardriving to discover wireless devices and find the IP range of these wireless devices. To use it, you need a wireless NIC adapter that can monitor wireless network traffic and inject data packets into the wireless network, and a laptop that can connect to it.
      * **Gpsd**: This program is used to perform wardriving to detect GPS devices and discover wireless networks on those GPS devices. That is, it uses GPSSD to detect GPS devices and uses Kismet to discover wireless networks on those GPS devices. To use it, you need a GlobalSat BU-353-S4 dongle and a laptop that can connect to it.
  * **Active Systems Detection Protocol**: This describes the network protocol used to detect the wireless networks of the organization connected to the organization's network or the wireless networks of key individuals of the organization connected to the organization's network, access these wireless networks, and discover the organization's network from these wireless networks and discover the physical devices and virtual devices actively operating on that network.
    * **ICMP**: ICMP, which stands for Internet Control Message Protocol, is a part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. It is used to diagnose problems in networks. ICMP is a network diagnostic protocol that generates and sends error messages to the network to indicate any problems in the network. This explains how it works and what it is designed for.
    * Any network device that uses the TCP/IP suite can send, receive, and process ICMP messages. Therefore, it is necessary to configure restrictions on how ICMP should operate to prevent ICMP messages from flooding the organization's network and the IT Security Lab network. To prevent ICMP messages from flooding the organization's network and the IT Security Lab network, configure ICMP packets as normal traffic without giving special priority. Configure configurations to reject ICMP packets. Configure to reply to ICMP in a protocol other than ICMP. Configure not to reply to multicast broadcast ICMP requests. These are the solutions to prevent ICMP messages from flooding the organization's network and the IT Security Lab network.
      * **Ping & Sweep Programs**: Since the protocol does not specify what data should be in an ICMP packet, ICMP can be used for different purposes and different uses. Different programs are used for this. Additionally, sweep programs are used to ping all IP addresses in the IP address range of the organization's network, one after the other, using ICMP to identify which devices on the organization's network are operational. These two categories of programs are also explained here.
        * **Ping**: Ping is an ICMP program used to test network connectivity. But, ping is also used to check whether a device at a specific IP address on an organization's network is operational.
        * An ICMP Echo Request is sent to a specified IP address on the organization's network and the device at that specified IP address is identified as operational based on the reply message received.
        * **Fping**: This program is used to ping all IP addresses on the organization's network one after another using ICMP, in order to identify which devices on the organization's network are working.
        * **Hping3**: This program is used to ping all IP addresses on the route that transmits data for a specific IP address on the organization's network using ICMP, thereby identifying which devices on the route that transmit data for that specific IP address are running.
        * **Nmap**: This is a port scanning program. This program is used to ping all IP addresses on an organization's network using ICMP, one after the other. This allows you to determine which devices on the organization's network are up and running.
