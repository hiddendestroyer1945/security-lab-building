# Building Software Test Platform
*   **Description**: This document explains the construction of a software test platform to build a IT security lab network. Additionly to explain about the, introduction, software test platform, reason for using virtualization, virtualization, types of virtualization, operating system installation, 'software and applications' and backuping.
   
*   **Introduction**: Since it is not possible to conduct tests on the production network, this explains how to build a software test platform on a virtualization computer in the IT security lab network, the different virtualization options used for that, the different operating system options used in this software test platform, and the different software and application options used in it.
*   The software test platform uses the Kali Linux operating system for testing and a mix of Linux and Windows operating systems for other operations. But, open source software is used for specific tasks on these operating systems.
   
*   **Software Test Platform**: The software test platform is a virtual network built on the IT Security Lab network. This software test platform will have a virtual network that provides an isolated environment from other networks and a virtual network that can communicate with the IT Security Lab network only when needed. That is, a software test platform is a combination of hypervisors that create virtual networks, the virtual networks within them, the virtual computers in these virtual networks, and the software programs in these virtual computers.
    *   **Reason for Using Virtualization**: The software test platform is being built virtually in the IT Security Lab network to minimize the need for hardware in the IT Security Lab network, maximize the use of existing hardware, and quickly resolve any problems or restore damaged components resulting from network tests and experiments.  In addition, conducting tests and experiments on production networks or physical networks can damage them and render important components unusable.
    
* **Virtualization**: Virtualization is the process of creating small computers in software form within a physical computer that emulate the hardware components of a physical computer. The virtualization server is the physical computer that performs the virtualization. Virtualization is used to run multiple operating systems inside a physical computer.
* Virtualization emulates the physical computer's microprocessor, RAM, hard disk, keyboard, mouse, network controller, audio controller, video controller, USB controller, and serial controller. However, the virtualization physical computer must have multiple microprocessor cores and speed, multiple memory channels, RAM, and hard disk capacity, and technology to enable virtualization.
* **Types of Virtualization**: This explains the different types of virtualization.
  * **Application Virtualization**: This is a method of building a software computer within a physical computer by emulating the physical components of a physical computer into the computer architecture required to run that application, in order to use software tools used to develop certain types of applications.
  * **Mainframe Virtualization**: This is a method of creating and providing small computers in the form of software by simulating the hardware components within that physical computer and the hardware components shared from other physical computers to that physical computer. In this way, the hardware resources of this physical computer and the hardware resources shared to this physical computer can be shared with any other physical computer, access to these shared resources can be controlled, and the permissions of different user accounts to these shared resources can be controlled. This method is used in large organizations. By using this method in an IT security lab network, it is very easy to understand the workings of security devices, perform patch testing, and train for certification exams. For this, VMware Server, KVM Server, and Hyper-V Server are used.
    * **VMware Server**: This method is used to build large software test platforms. All network devices and computers in an IT security lab network, except for the border router and wireless security devices, can be built this way. Since this is a paid virtualization server operating system, it is not recommended for building software test platforms.
    * **KVM Server**: This method is used to build large software test platforms. All of its packages are available in Debian Linux. But, in some Linux distributions, these packages are only available with a subscription. All network devices and computers in the IT Security Lab network, except the border router and wireless security devices, can be built in this way. But, it is installed and configured on a large physical server computer used for virtualization.
    * Before installing this, the server computer on which it is to be installed must have a hard disk to run the base Linux operating system and another hard disk to create and run virtual computers. In addition, this server must have a partition shared from the NAS server to share the data on the IT Security Lab network with authorized persons in the organization.
    * To install a KVM server, a suitable Linux distribution is installed on the physical server for this purpose. Then, the KVM server packages are installed on that operating system. Then, the necessary configurations for the KVM server are configured. Then, the necessary virtual network is created in the KVM server's virtual machine manager and this virtual network is connected to the physical server's NIC. Then a software test platform is created on this virtual network, which consists of the necessary routers, firewalls, and computers.
    * **Hyper-V Server**: This method is used to build large software test platforms on the Windows Server operating system. All network devices and computers in the IT Security Lab network, except for the border router and wireless security devices, can be built in this way. However, Windows operating systems are not recommended as base operating systems in the IT Security Lab network.
