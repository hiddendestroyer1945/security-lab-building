# Building Software Test Platform
*   **Description**: This document explains the construction of a software test platform to build a IT security lab network. Additionly to explain about the, introduction, software test platform, reason for using virtualization, virtualization, types of virtualization, operating system installation, 'software and applications' and backuping.
   
*   **Introduction**: Since it is not possible to conduct tests on the production network, this explains how to build a software test platform on a virtualization computer in the IT security lab network, the different virtualization options used for that, the different operating system options used in this software test platform, and the different software and application options used in it.
*   The software test platform uses the Kali Linux operating system for testing and a mix of Linux and Windows operating systems for other operations. But, open source software is used for specific tasks on these operating systems.
   
*   **Software Test Platform**: The software test platform is a virtual network built on the IT Security Lab network. This software test platform will have a virtual network that provides an isolated environment from other networks and a virtual network that can communicate with the IT Security Lab network only when needed. That is, a software test platform is a combination of hypervisors that create virtual networks, the virtual networks within them, the virtual computers in these virtual networks, and the software programs in these virtual computers.
    *   **Reason for Using Virtualization**: The software test platform is being built virtually in the IT Security Lab network to minimize the need for hardware in the IT Security Lab network, maximize the use of existing hardware, and quickly resolve any problems or restore damaged components resulting from network tests and experiments.  In addition, conducting tests and experiments on production networks or physical networks can damage them and render important components unusable.
    
* **Virtualization**: Virtualization is the process of creating small computers in software form within a physical computer that emulate the hardware components of a physical computer. The virtualization server is the physical computer that performs the virtualization. Virtualization is used to run multiple operating systems inside a physical computer.
* Virtualization emulates the physical computer's microprocessor, RAM, hard disk, keyboard, mouse, network controller, audio controller, video controller, USB controller, and serial controller. However, the virtualization physical computer must have multiple microprocessor cores and speed, multiple memory channels, RAM, and hard disk capacity, and technology to enable virtualization.
* **Types of Virtualization**: This explains the different types of virtualization.
  * **Application Virtualization**: This is a method of building a software computer within a physical computer by emulating the physical components of a physical computer into the computer architecture required to run that application, in order to use software tools used to develop certain types of applications.
  * **Mainframe Virtualization**: This is a method of creating and providing small computers in the form of software by simulating the hardware components within physical computer and the hardware components shared from other physical computers to that physical computer. In this way, the hardware resources of this physical computer and the hardware resources shared to this physical computer can be shared with any other physical computer, access to these shared resources can be controlled, and the permissions of different user accounts to these shared resources can be controlled. This method is used in large organizations. By using this method in an IT security lab network, it is very easy to understand the workings of security devices, perform patch testing, and train for certification exams. For this, VMware Server, KVM Server, and Hyper-V Server are used.
    * **VMware Server**: This method is used to build large software test platforms. All network devices and computers in an IT security lab network, except for the border router and wireless security devices, can be built this way. Since this is a paid virtualization server operating system, it is not recommended for building software test platforms.
    * **KVM Server**: This method is used to build large software test platforms. All of its packages are available in Debian Linux. But, in some Linux distributions, these packages are only available with a subscription. All network devices and computers in the IT Security Lab network, except the border router and wireless security devices, can be built in this way. But, it is installed and configured on a large physical server computer used for virtualization.
    * Before installing this, the server computer on which it is to be installed must have a hard disk to run the base Linux operating system and another hard disk to create and run virtual computers. In addition, this server must have a partition shared from the NAS server to share the data on the IT Security Lab network with authorized persons in the organization.
    * To install a KVM server, a suitable Linux distribution is installed on the physical server for this purpose. Then, the KVM server packages are installed on that operating system. Then, the necessary configurations for the KVM server are configured. Then, the necessary virtual network is created in the KVM server's virtual machine manager and this virtual network is connected to the physical server's NIC. Then a software test platform is created on this virtual network, which consists of the necessary routers, firewalls, and computers.
    * **Hyper-V Server**: This method is used to build large software test platforms on the Windows Server operating system. All network devices and computers in the IT Security Lab network, except for the border router and wireless security devices, can be built in this way. However, Windows operating systems are not recommended as base operating systems in the IT Security Lab network.
  * **Parallel Virtualization**: It is a method of creating different partitions within a physical computer, installing different operating systems on each partition, and accessing and using only one operating system at a time. This method is not recommended for building IT security lab networks.
  * **Operating System Virtualization**: This is a method of creating small computers in software form by having virtualization software installed on the operating system inside a physical computer, simulating the hardware components inside that physical computer. This may seem similar to mainframe virtualization, but it does not possible virtualize as many components or impose as many restrictions as mainframe virtualization. In this, the operating system on the physical computer is considered the host, and the virtual computers created in virtualization software are considered guests. But, it is possible to share hard disks and storage devices available to this basic operating system and control user permissions to these shares. By using this method in an IT security lab network, it is much easier to understand the functions of security tools, perform patch testing, and train for certification exams.  For this, VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, and Hyper-V are used.
    * **VMware Workstation**: This method is used to build a software test platforms. All network devices and computers in an IT security lab network can be built this way, except for the border router and wireless security devices. The size of the software test platform that can be built using this depends on the number of cores in the microprocessor available on the physical computer being virtualized, the capacity of the RAM memory, and the capacity of the hard disk. Although it is also available in Linux operating systems, it is not suitable for the Linux architecture and has the probability to disrupt other programs and services in Linux.
    * **VirtualBox**: This method is used to build a software test platforms. All network devices and computers in an IT security lab network can be built this way, except for the border router and wireless security devices. The size of the software test platform that can be built using this depends on the number of cores in the microprocessor available on the physical computer being virtualized, the capacity of the RAM memory, and the capacity of the hard disk. It is available in Linux operating systems and is suitable for the Linux architecture. It works equally well on Linux operating systems and Windows operating systems. It is a lightweight program, making it well suited to the Linux architecture. How to it installed in Linux, is available from its official website https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads. But before that, all this packages must be installed in the Linux operating system using the command sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r) curl wget gnupg. Only then will VirtualBox work smoothly on Linux. But, the EXE file for installation on Windows is available from its official website https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.
    * Before installing it, the physical computer to be installed must have one hard disk to run the base Linux operating system, another hard disk to create and run virtual computers, and another hard disk to share data on the software test platform. In order to share data in the software test platform in this way, this VirtualBox extension package must be installed in that program. Then the command sudo usermod –aG vboxusers $USER is executed. This extension package can be obtained from the VirtualBox Extension Pack on the official VirtualBox website at https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.
    * **Hyper-V**: This method is used to build software test platforms on the Windows operating system. All network devices and computers in the IT Security Lab network, except for the border router and wireless security devices, can be built in this way. However, Windows operating systems are not recommended as base operating systems in the IT Security Lab network. 
* **Operating System Installation**: It explains the different types of operating systems that are installed on virtual computers in the software test platform on the IT Security Lab network and how to install them.
  * **Microsoft Windows**: Microsoft Windows, with its graphical interface, is the most widely used operating system in the world. Therefore, they must be included in the software test platform in the IT security lab network. Windows has separate operating systems for client needs and server needs.
  * Since Windows operating systems are proprietary operating systems, they can only be obtained by paying for them. But, cracked versions of Windows operating systems are also available on the Internet, but they are not secure. But, if that operating system is used for a specific purpose on the software test platform of the IT Security Lab Network, it is best to use the latest version of the Windows operating system that suits that specific purpose. But, for experiments, it is best to use older versions of the Windows client operating system or server operating system that have security vulnerabilities.
    * **Installation**: The amount of hardware components required for different versions of Windows operating systems will be different. Therefore, before installing the Windows operating system on the software test platform in the IT Security Lab network, it is necessary to find out the capacity of the hardware components required for that specific version of Windows operating system from Microsoft's official website and ensure that the physical computer on which the software test platform is built has that hardware capacity and the hardware capacity to run the base operating system of the software test platform. Then the ISO file of the specific version of Windows operating system is downloaded from the official website of Microsoft.
    * In the hypervisor of the physical computer that makes up the software test platform creates a virtual computer with slightly more capacity than the hardware capacity required to run the specific version of the operating system to be installed. It then ensures that all the virtual configurations of this virtual computer are correct.
    * The installation process begins by selecting the ISO file of the specified Windows operating system as the installation media for the virtual computer on which the specified operating system is to be installed on the software test platform and starting the virtual computer. Then, the installation process continues by selecting the language, time and currency format, and keyboard layout for this virtual computer and creating and formatting the partition required to install this operating system on this virtual computer. During this installation process, this operating system is downloaded from the ISO file to the virtual hard disk where the Windows operating system is to be installed and then installed.
    * After the installation process of the specific version of the Windows operating system on the software test platform, the virtual computer on which that operating system is installed is restarted. Then, the hostname, workgroup, domain name, and user accounts of the virtual computer that were previously planned are configured. Then, the network configurations and other configurations of this computer are configured and this virtual computer is restarted and made available for login.
  * **Linux**: Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is widely used in the world. Therefore, it must be included in the software test platform in the IT security lab network. Linux has separate operating systems for client needs and server needs.
