# Passive Information Gathering of Organizations
* **Description**: This document explains how to collect passive information about an organization and build a profile of that organization. Additionly to explain about the, introduction, information gathering, information gathering from the source, location based information gathering, mining the job ads and alalyzing financial data, using google to mine sensitive information, exploring domain ownership and gathered infomation table.

* **Introduction**: It explains the different methods used to collect passive information about an organization from the software test platform in the IT Security Lab network, the software programs used for that, how should a security professional think about for collecting passive information about an organization??, and how to build a profile of that organization using the information available.

* **Information Gathering**: Information gathering is the act of collecting data for a specific purpose. That is, data is collected to profiling a specific target and the information in that data is used to attack.
* The attacker searches the Internet to see if there is any information available that could be used to attack any of the organization's assets, while the security expert checks the Internet to see if has made any information available on the Internet that could be used to attack.

* **Information Gathering Starts from the Source**: The search for information about a company starts from the company's website. The About Us section on the company's website will contain information about the company's name, its executive members, and its holdings.
* It is difficult to directly attack the networks of large organizations. But, when small organizations merge with large organizations, the emphasis is more on connectivity between the networks of the two organizations than on security, so the security between these two networks is low, and it is possible to infiltrate the networks of this large organization through the networks of the small organization.Therefore, it is advisable to exclude information about such mergers from the website and the Internet.

* **Location Based Information Gathering**: If information about the physical locations of organizations' offices is available, this information can be used to availe other information about the organization through certain actions. Therefore, it is best to avoid such information from websites and the Internet. This describes the activities that use information about the physical location of an organization's offices to avail other information about that organization.
  * **Dumpster Diving**: Dumpster diving is the act of searching for information about a organization in the dumpsters of its offices. Dumpster diving is a type of information gathering activity that is used to collect information about a company's employees, such as their names, addresses, and phone numbers. But sometimes operation manuals and configuration guides and financial documents may be available from such dumpsters.
  * To combat such information gathering activity, it is important to ensure that all data dumped from organizations' offices to external dumpsters is destroyed before being dumped into such dumpsters.
  * **Wardriving**: Wardriving is the process of discovering wireless networks in a organizations's offices and the status of these wireless networks. Wardriving involves discovering wireless networks in a company's offices and discovering networks and computers that are directly connected to the Internet using these wireless networks.
  * Wireless networks are become victim to the data collection activity known as wardriving because wireless devices are not configured with encryption, weak encryption is configured, and wireless access points for wireless networks are placed in physically unsecured locations.
  * If the wireless access points of wireless networks are placed in a physically unsecured location, a person who is wardriving can reset or reprogram the wireless access point and thereby gain access to that wireless access point.
  * To prevent wardriving activities, configure the strongest encryption configurations available on wireless access points, do not broadcast the SSIDs of wireless access points, and place wireless access points in secure locations.
  * **Wardialing**: Wardialing is the process of finding the area code number of an organization from the phone numbers available on its website, and then using a dial-up modem to dial and scan all the phone numbers under this area code number to find the organization's dial-up modem phone number. This operation is performed to locate computers connected to a dial-up Internet modem.
  * Although dial-up modems are obsolete, large organizations still rely on dial-up modems for backup connectivity. Dial-up modems use weak authentication methods, which can allow attackers to infiltrate the organization's network. Dial-up Internet modems are used by organizations to provide easy access to the Internet in the event of an unexpected loss of Internet connection while using a broadband Internet modem.
    * **ToneLock**: This software dials the phone numbers in each area code in the input file provided to the program and finds phone numbers with a frequency that matches the carrier frequency of the dialup Internet mode from the dial tones of the phone numbers with dial tones.
    * **THC-Scan**: Although this software program performs the same function as ToneLock, it is a software program that runs on the DOS operating system.
    * **Demon Dialer**: This is a software program used to monitor the phone number of a dial-up Internet modem detected using ToneLock and THC-Scan to determine whether this dial-up modem have authentication and, if so, to detect that authentication.
