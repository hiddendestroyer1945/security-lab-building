# Passive Information Gathering of Organizations
* **Description**: This document explains how to collect passive information about an organization and build a profile of that organization. Additionly to explain about the, introduction, information gathering, information gathering from the source,  information gathering from other sources, mining the job ads and alalyzing financial data, using google to mine sensitive information, exploring domain ownership and gathered infomation table.

* **Introduction**: It explains the different methods used to collect passive information about an organization from the software test platform in the IT Security Lab network, the software programs used for that, how should a security professional think about for collecting passive information about an organization??, and how to build a profile of that organization using the information available.

* **Information Gathering**: Information gathering is the act of collecting data for a specific purpose. That is, data is collected to profiling a specific target and the information in that data is used to attack.
* The attacker searches the Internet to see if there is any information available that could be used to attack any of the organization's assets, while the security expert checks the Internet to see if has made any information available on the Internet that could be used to attack.

* **Information Gathering Starts from the Source**: The search for information about a organization starts from the organization's website. The About Us section on the organization's website will contain information about the organization's name, its important individuals, and its holdings.  Information about the networks of some institutions is also available from their websites. Information about mergers that an organization is undertaking with other organizations is also available from  organization websites and some news websites. Information about the physical location of some institutions may be available on their websites.
  * **Network Based Information Gathering**: It is difficult to directly attack the networks of large organizations. But, when small organizations merge with large organizations, the emphasis is more on connectivity between the networks of the two organizations than on security, so the security between these two networks is low, and it is possible to infiltrate the networks of this large organization through the networks of the small organization.Therefore, it is advisable to exclude information about such mergers from the website and the Internet.
  * Organizations should not publish information about their networks on their websites or the Internet. Such information collected from the Internet and the organization's website can give an attacker a preconceived idea about the organization's network and help them understand what obstacles need to be overcome on that network and what precautions need to be taken.
  * **Key Individuals Based Information Gathering**:  Using information collected about key individuals from an organization's website, it is possible to learn the physical addresses and other information of those individuals, use them to track them, physically hack their laptops, and collect information from such devices sufficient to infiltrate the organization's network.
  * Using information collected about key individuals from an organization's website, it is possible to collect the social media information of those individuals and use that social media information to launch phishing attacks on their laptops or phones through those social media accounts. It is then possible to attack the organization's networks from these laptops.
    * **Scrutinizing Key Individuals**: It is possible to collect information about key individuals in the organization, available from the organization's website or social media platforms such as LinkedIn, and using that information, to collect information about the physical location of key individuals in the organization from the Internet and websites that provide information about those individuals, from websites that provide information about individuals living in specific locations, and from websites that provide information about individuals performing specific jobs, and then to go directly to those physical locations and conduct ward driving, collect information about the wireless networks of these key individuals, and use these wireless networks to infiltrate the organization's network. 
    * There are websites available on the Internet that can collect information about the physical location of individuals using information about key individuals in the organization available from the organization's website or social media platforms such as LinkedIn, websites that provide location maps to the individuals' residences, websites that can understand the position of individuals in the organization, and websites that can collect individuals' phone numbers and emails. Such websites are used for such data collection.
    * To prevent data collection using key individuals in the organization, the publication of information about key individuals in the organization on the organization's websites and social media accounts should be discontinued. In addition, avoid publishing the name and information of the organization along with information about key individuals in online phone directories, labor union websites, and websites focused on specific locations.
  * **Location Based Information Gathering**: If information about the physical locations of organizations' offices is available from their websites or the internet, this information can be used to avail other information about the organization through certain actions. Therefore, it is best to avoid such information from websites and the Internet. This describes the activities that use information about the physical location of an organization's offices to avail other information about that organization.
    * **Dumpster Diving**: Dumpster diving is the act of searching for information about a organization in the dumpsters of its offices. Dumpster diving is a type of information gathering activity that is used to collect information about a company's employees, such as their names, addresses, and phone numbers. But sometimes operation manuals and configuration guides and financial documents may be available from such dumpsters.
    * To combat such information gathering activity, it is important to ensure that all data dumped from organizations' offices to external dumpsters is destroyed before being dumped into such dumpsters.
    * **Wardriving**: Wardriving is the process of discovering wireless networks in a organizations's offices and the status of these wireless networks. Wardriving involves discovering wireless networks in a company's offices and discovering networks and computers that are directly connected to the Internet using these wireless networks.
    * Wireless networks are become victim to the data collection activity known as wardriving because wireless devices are not configured with encryption, weak encryption is configured, and wireless access points for wireless networks are placed in physically unsecured locations.
    * If the wireless access points of wireless networks are placed in a physically unsecured location, a person who is wardriving can reset or reprogram the wireless access point and thereby gain access to that wireless access point.
    * To prevent wardriving activities, configure the strongest encryption configurations available on wireless access points, do not broadcast the SSIDs of wireless access points, and place wireless access points in secure locations.
    * **Wardialing**: Wardialing is the process of finding the area code number of an organization from the phone numbers available on its website, and then using a dial-up modem to dial and scan all the phone numbers under this area code number to find the organization's dial-up modem phone number. This operation is performed to locate computers connected to a dial-up Internet modem.
    * Although dial-up modems are obsolete, large organizations still rely on dial-up modems for backup connectivity. Dial-up modems use weak authentication methods, which can allow attackers to infiltrate the organization's network. Dial-up Internet modems are used by organizations to provide easy access to the Internet in the event of an unexpected loss of Internet connection while using a broadband Internet modem.
      * **ToneLock**: This software dials the phone numbers in each area code in the input file provided to the program and finds phone numbers with a frequency that matches the carrier frequency of the dialup Internet mode from the dial tones of the phone numbers with dial tones.
      * **THC-Scan**: Although this software program performs the same function as ToneLock, it is a software program that runs on the DOS operating system.
      * **Demon Dialer**: This is a software program used to monitor the phone number of a dial-up Internet modem detected using ToneLock and THC-Scan to determine whether this dial-up modem have authentication and, if so, to detect that authentication.
* **Information Gathering from Other Sources**: Information about the institution can be obtained from other sources besides the institution's websites, which are explained here.
  * **Electronic Dumpster Diving**: Electronic dumpster diving is the activity of finding outdated, obscure, or old electronic data on the Internet. It can be avail from the website https://archive.org/.
  * The Internet Archive Wayback Machine, which provides access to outdated or old electronic data on the Internet, has over 1 trillion web pages, over 48 million texts, over 1 million videos, over 13 million audios, over 1 million software, and over 5 million images on its website https://archive.org/.
  * To retrieve an old web page of an institution's website from the Wayback Machine, search for the institution's website URL on its website https://archive.org/ and select a snapshot in a specific date from the calendar that appears. But, to search for specific types of files, select the category of those files and search for the specific file name on the page that appears.
  * You can upload your organization's website or any other files to the Wayback Machine and make them available. To do this, create a user account on the Wayback Machine website https://archive.org/ and use the Upload button.
  * If the organization's website contains confidential information about the organization, they can be removed. But, if the organization's confidential information reaches dark places on the Internet, such as the Wayback Machine, it cannot be removed from there. Therefore, in the process of checking the security of an organization's network, it is necessary to check and confirm whether confidential information about the organization is available in such dark places on the Internet before checking the security of the organization's network.
  * Dissatisfied with the policies and practices of the organization, the organization's own employees publish confidential information that can compromise the organization's networks in dark places on the Internet, such as the Wayback Machine. They use anonymous email services and Tor networks to do this, making them difficult to detect in the usual way.
  * **Information Gathering from Sucks Domains**: Sucks domains are domains that have the top-level domain name .sucks, such as .org, .com, and .net, in the domain name of an organization. You can check if a Sucks domain has been registered using the name of your organization's website or organization at https://get.sucks/. You can also search for the registration information, status information, and DNS information of a registered Sucks domain at https://get.sucks/whois/. You can also search for other domain names similar to your domain name at https://who.is/.
  * Employees of an organization who are dissatisfied with the organization's policies and practices publish confidential information that can compromise the organization's networks on websites using a sucks domain name for the organization's domain name or on websites using a domain name that is similar to the organization's domain name. To do this, they use anonymous email services and Tor networks, which make them difficult to detect in the usual way. To prevent this, the organization itself registers and maintains a sucks domain name of the organization's domain name and domain names that are similar to the organization's domain name. Such suck domains can be registered and obtained from websites such as https://www.101domain.com/sucks.htm and https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/sucks/. Domains with names similar to the organization's name can be registered and obtained from the websites https://www.101domain.com and https://www.namecheap.com/domains/domain-name-search/.
  * **Information Gathering from Blogs**: Employees of an organization who are dissatisfied with the policies and practices of the organization publish confidential information that compromises the organization's networks on tech blog websites. To do this, they use anonymous email services and Tor networks, which make it difficult to detect them in the usual way. The only way to prevent this is to regularly check the blog websites used by the organization's employees.
  * **Information Gathering from Dark Websites**: Employees who are dissatisfied with an organization's policies and practices sell or post confidential information that could compromise the organization's networks to websites that sell such information for money. To do this, they use anonymous email services and the Tor network, which usually makes it difficult to detect them. Such websites are found on the surface web, the dark web, and the deep web.
  * https://proton.me/mail, https://temp-mail.org/en/, https://www.guerrillamail.com/, https://addy.io/, and https://tempr.email/ are anonymous email services used for anonymous activities.
  * http://hxuzjtocnzvv5g2rtg2bhwkcbupmk7rclb6lly3fo4tvqkk5oyrv3nid.onion/?lang=en, http://2nxpboa3ya52j5au4gxwkdt4nxoh5g4y4f3tuqedlza46y35jmv6doid.onion/, and http://torbox36ijlcevujx7mjb4oiusvwgvmue7jfn2cvutwa6kl6to3uyqad.onion/lang/en are dark web email services used for anonymous activities.
  * **Information Gathering from Analyzing Web Page Source Code**: A lot of highly confidential information about an organization can be gathered by analyzing the source code of that organizations websites. 
  * Gatherable Confidential Information: These include email addresses, links to other sites, notes and comments, hidden files, information about the applications and programs used to develop the organization's website, and information about the website's structure and design.
  * To examine websites in detail, they are copied to the operating system using site ripper programs and then examined. When websites are copied in this way, they are made available as programming files. Therefore, they can be examined very easily. However, for this task, the security expert must have knowledge of programming languages ​​such as HTML, JavaScript, PHP, CSS and python.
  * <u>Site Ripper Programs</u>: HTTrack is a site tracking program that can be used on both Linux and Windows operating systems. Wget is a site tracking program that can only be used on Linux operating systems.
